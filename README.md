## 🎛 Features Overview

---

### 🎵 MIDI Tempo

### 🎚 MIDI Modify

Modify incoming MIDI messages in two main ways:

#### 🌀 Channel Mode

- **MIDI Change**  
  Redirect all incoming MIDI messages to one or two selected MIDI channels.
  This allows you to play two synths at the same time.
  Also allows very quick channel changes between scenes.

- **MIDI Split**  
  Split the keyboard into two zones:  
  - Notes below a split point go to one MIDI channel.  
  - Notes above go to another.  
  Ideal for controlling two synths with one keyboard.

> The split point and both output channels are fully configurable.

> The switch between MIDI Change and MIDI Split is made by pressing the select button when selecting a MIDI Change or MIDI Split item

> The OUTs are fully configurable between OUT 1, OUT 2, OUT 1 & 2 & Split.
---

#### 🎛 Velocity Mode

- **Velocity Change**  
  Add or subtract velocity from the incoming signal.  
  *(Range: -50 to +50)*  
  Preserves dynamic expression.

- **Fixed Velocity**  
  All incoming notes are set to a fixed velocity.  
  Useful for consistent volume or triggering.

  > The switch between Velocity Change and Fixed Velocity is made by pressing the select button when selecting a velocity item

### 🎼 MIDI Transpose

Apply real-time note transformations to incoming MIDI notes.

#### 📉 Pitch Shift

- Shift all incoming notes up/down by a specified number of semitones.  
- Optionally **mute the original note**.

#### 🎶 Scale Mode (Harmonizer)

- Select a **scale**, **mode**, and **interval**.  
- The pedal generates a harmonized note based on the input.

> Optionally mute the original note only to hear the harmony.

> The switch between Pitch Shift and Scale Mode is made by pressing the select button in the Transpose menu
